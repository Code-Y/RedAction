## Documentation


## Motivation

**[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)** is great, every recent web application has most likely been built on top of it. **How can we make it even better?**

 - **Î» Go Functional**, Everything is a function and reducers are built by function composition rather than piling up if and switch-case statements: *Let's introduce Redux Fluent Reducers*.
 - **Reducers at scale**, due to being handling multiple actions, reducers tend to grow and become difficult to maintain: *Let's introduce Redux Fluent Action Handlers*.
 - **Less boilerplate**, Flux architecture is usually verbose and some of their concepts, such as `Action`, `Action Type` and `Action Creator` could all be implemented in a single entity: *Let's introduce Redux Fluent Actions*.
 - **FSA compliance**, FSA Actions may have a `error: boolean` field, which indicates whether the action represents a failure or not. Respecting this pattern leads to a series of if statements inside reducers, compromising both readability and maintainability, so the community normally tends to split error and failures into two separate actions (eg: `ADD_TODO_SUCCESS` and `ADD_TODO_ERROR`) which reduces cognitive complexity on one hand but produces even more boilerplate on the other. *Let's embrace FSA and abstract error handling with filterable action handlers*.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add redux-fluent
```

## Getting Started

```javascript
/** todos.actions.js **/
import { createAction } from 'redux-fluent';

export const addTodo = createAction('todos | add');
```

```javascript
/** todos.reducer.js **/
import { createReducer, ofType } from 'redux-fluent';
import * as actions from './todos.actions.js';

const addTodo = (state, { payload }) => state.concat(payload);

export const todos = createReducer('todos')
  .actions(
    ofType(actions.addTodo).map(addTodo),
    /* and so on */
  )
  .default(() => []); 
```

```javascript
/** application.js **/
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { combineReducers } from 'redux-fluent';
import * as actions from './todos.actions.js';
import { todos } from './todos.reducer.js';

const rootReducer = combineReducers(todos, ...);
const store = createStore(rootReducer);
store.getState(); // { todos: [] }

store.dispatch(actions.addTodo('1'));
store.getState(); // { todos: [1] }
```
