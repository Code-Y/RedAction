Tiny and eloquent way to manage a redux-like state manager (*3K*, dependencies free, definitions included).

[Try it out on RunKit](https://runkit.com/hitmands/5a6ae5fccfee52001263345f)


## Documentation

1. [Action](./docs/Action.MD)
2. [Reducer](./docs/Reducer.MD)
3. [CombinableReducers](./docs/CombinableReducers.MD)

## Motivation

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is great, *every recent web application was most likely been built on top of it*, however we really think we can simplify it further and, after our investigation, we came out with:

 - **Reducers** tend to grow and become hard to maintain, 'cause of the amount of switch-cases.
 - Concepts such as **Action**, **Action Type** and **Action Creator** could be squashed into only one.
 - [FSA action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action#actions) may have `error = true` but this involves `IF Statements` inside reducers, so, developers tend to have separate `cases` via `ACTION_SUCCESS` and `ACTION_ERROR`.
 - Uncontrolled scaffolding growth.

**Why not [redux-actions](https://github.com/reduxactions/redux-actions)?** It does merge the concepts of `Action` and `Reducer` while we think an action should only [describe the state changes](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/CoreConcepts.html) and not provide any implementation. Actions may be handled by multiple reducers or middlewares.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save redux-fluent
```

## Getting Started

```javascript
/** todosReducer.js **/
import { createAction, createReducer } from 'redux-fluent';


const addTodo = createAction('@@todos | add');
const addTodoTask = (state, { payload }) => ({
  ...state,
  list: state.list.concat(payload),
});

const todosReducer = createReducer('@@todos')
  .case(addTodo)
  .then(addTodoTask)

  .default()
;

export { todosReducer, addTodo };
```

```javascript
/** application.js **/
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { createCombinableReducers } from 'redux-fluent';
import { otherReducer } from './otherReducer';
import { todosReducer, addTodo } from './todosReducer';


const reducers = combineReducers(
  createCombinableReducers(todosReducer, otherReducer),
);

const store = createStore(reducers);

// You can think of `addTodo` as an action creator itself
store.dispatch(
  addTodo({
    id: 1,
    title: 'Walk Gipsy',
  }),
);
```
